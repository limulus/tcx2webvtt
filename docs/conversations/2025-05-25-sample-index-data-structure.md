## User Prompt

I am working on a tool called `tcx2webvtt` written in TypeScript. I’ve attached the readme at the bottom of this message.

I am starting to work on the `--fcp` functionality.

I am trying to figure out what data structure I should use that will let the tool take multiple TCX workouts (which contain timestamped samples) and also take the timestamp data from clips in the video editor timeline export, and produce a timeline with the TCX sample data re-arranged to match the video.

Help me brainstorm ideas on how to accomplish this. Ask me any relevant questions.

# tcx2webvtt

Convert a [TCX] workout file to [WebVTT] with JSON metadata

[tcx]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML
[webvtt]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebVTT

## Requirements

A system with [Node.js] v20 or higher.

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/

## Usage

Install globally, or run without installing using `npx`.

```sh
npm install -g tcx2webvtt
```

Convert a TCX workout file to WebVTT.

```sh
tcx2webvtt my-workout.tcx > my-track.vtt
```

### Using With Final Cut Pro

You can use an export of a Final Cut Pro project to extract the relevant parts of the TCX
workout file and produce a synchronized WebVTT file.

To create an export of your project, first [create a metadata view] in Final Cut Pro named
`tcx2webvtt`. Add the “Content Created” metadata field to this view. Then select “Export
XML…” from the “File” menu. Choose the `tcx2webvtt` metadata view and XML version 1.13 or
higher. (Older versions may work fine, but they are untested.)

[create a metadata view]: https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/modify-metadata-views-ver397297af/11.1/mac/14.6

Now that you have an export, run `tcx2webvtt` with the `--fcp` option:

```sh
tcx2webvtt --fcp 'My Project Export.fcpxmld' my-workout.tcx > my-track.vtt
```

This is an interesting problem. The user wants to take TCX workout files (which contain timestamped samples of data like heart rate, GPS coordinates, etc.) and align them with video clips from a Final Cut Pro timeline export to produce a WebVTT file with synchronized metadata.

Let me think about the key challenges:

1. TCX files contain samples with timestamps (likely relative to the start of the workout)
2. Final Cut Pro timeline exports contain clips with their own timestamps/positions on the timeline
3. The user needs to map the TCX data to the video timeline, which means:
   - Extracting relevant portions of TCX data that correspond to each video clip
   - Re-timing the TCX data to match the video timeline
   - Handling gaps, overlaps, or other timeline complexities

Key questions I should ask:

- How are the TCX timestamps and FCP timeline timestamps related? Are they absolute timestamps or relative?
- How does the user know which parts of the TCX workout correspond to which video clips?
- Are there multiple TCX files that need to be merged/aligned?
- What happens when there are gaps in the video timeline?

Data structure considerations:

- Need to represent TCX samples with their timestamps
- Need to represent FCP timeline clips with their positions/durations
- Need to map between the two coordinate systems
- Need to output WebVTT cues with appropriate timing

Possible approaches:

1. Time-based mapping where each clip has metadata about which TCX file and time range it corresponds to
2. Content-based mapping using the "Content Created" timestamp to align TCX data with clips
3. Manual offset specification where the user provides timing offsets

I should ask clarifying questions to understand the exact workflow better.

</details>

Looking at this interesting problem, I need to understand a few key aspects of how the TCX data and FCP timeline relate to each other. Here are my questions:

1. **Time Alignment**: How do you envision the user specifying which portions of the TCX workout(s) correspond to which video clips in the FCP timeline? Is it based on:

   - The "Content Created" timestamp in the FCP metadata matching the timestamp in the TCX file?
   - Manual offset specification?
   - Some other metadata field?

2. **Multiple TCX Files**: You mentioned "multiple TCX workouts" - does this mean:

   - Different clips in the timeline might come from different workout sessions?
   - The user might be creating a video that combines footage from multiple workouts?

3. **Timeline Gaps**: What should happen when there are gaps in the FCP timeline? Should the WebVTT output:

   - Have no cues during those gaps?
   - Interpolate/continue data from the previous clip?

4. **TCX Sample Mapping**: When a video clip represents only a portion of a TCX workout (say minutes 5-8 of a 30-minute workout), do you need to:
   - Shift those timestamps to match the clip's position in the timeline?
   - Preserve any relative timing within that segment?

Based on typical approaches, here are some data structure ideas:

**Option 1: Clip-based mapping**

```typescript
interface TimelineClip {
  startTime: number // position in timeline (seconds)
  duration: number
  sourceFile?: string // which TCX file
  sourceOffset?: number // offset into TCX file
  contentCreated?: Date // from FCP metadata
}

interface TCXSample {
  timestamp: Date // absolute time
  data: Record<string, any> // heart rate, GPS, etc.
}
```

**Option 2: Unified timeline approach**

```typescript
interface TimelineSegment {
  timelineStart: number
  timelineEnd: number
  tcxSource: {
    file: string
    startSample: number
    endSample: number
    timeOffset: number // to align TCX time with timeline time
  }
}
```

Which approach resonates more with your vision for the tool?

## User Prompt

Some answers:

1. The Content Created metadata will be used by default. We will probably need to support manual offsets for clips that for whatever reason do not have timestamps or have timestamps that are wrong or offset.

2. Yes! Different clips may correspond to different workouts — or even a clip may span more than one workout.

3. When there are gaps we should not be emitting any samples in the WebVTT file. Or to put another way, we should avoid interpolation of samples. We may want that feature in the future, but that is problem for later.

4. The resulting WebVTT track should only contain samples from times that appear in the video. The idea here is that we are using the WebVTT track (containing JSON metadata) to show widgets alongside the video to indicate the current data from the workout (ie, heart rate, speed, location on a map, etc). So samples taken at times not included in the video are irrelevant.

I am not sure what the best approach is, but I do know that what we will need to be able to extract the samples in sequential order to output the WebVTT track data.

## Claude

<details>
<summary>Thought Process</summary>

Based on the user's answers, I need to think about the requirements:

1. Content Created metadata is primary, but manual offsets needed
2. Clips can come from different workouts, or even span multiple workouts (!)
3. No interpolation - only emit samples that correspond to actual video time
4. The output needs to be sequential for the WebVTT track

Key challenges:

- A single clip might span multiple TCX files/workouts
- Need to map from video timeline time to TCX workout time
- Need to handle gaps cleanly
- Need to extract samples in sequential order for output

I think we need a data structure that:

1. Represents the video timeline with clips
2. Maps each clip to one or more TCX sources with time ranges
3. Can produce samples in timeline order

The fact that a clip can span multiple workouts is interesting - this suggests we need to handle cases where someone started recording, stopped their workout, started a new workout, and kept recording video.

</details>

Based on your answers, I think we need a data structure that handles the complexity of clips potentially spanning multiple workouts. Here's my refined approach:

```typescript
interface TimelineClip {
  // Timeline position
  timelineStart: number // seconds from start of video
  timelineEnd: number

  // Source video info from FCP
  contentCreated?: Date // from FCP metadata
  manualOffset?: number // user-specified offset in seconds

  // TCX mappings - array because clip might span workouts
  tcxMappings: TCXMapping[]
}

interface TCXMapping {
  tcxFile: string
  tcxStartTime: Date // absolute time in TCX file
  tcxEndTime: Date
  clipStartOffset: number // where in the clip this TCX segment starts
}

interface TCXWorkout {
  filename: string
  samples: TCXSample[] // sorted by timestamp
}

interface TCXSample {
  timestamp: Date
  data: {
    heartRate?: number
    speed?: number
    position?: { lat: number; lon: number }
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

Here's how this would work:

1. **Parse FCP timeline** to extract clips with their Content Created timestamps
2. **Load TCX files** and index them by time ranges
3. **Match clips to TCX segments**:
   - Use Content Created (+ manual offset) to find corresponding TCX time
   - If a clip spans multiple TCX files, create multiple mappings
4. **Generate samples** by walking through the timeline sequentially:
   ```typescript
   for (const clip of sortedClips) {
     for (const mapping of clip.tcxMappings) {
       // Extract samples from TCX that fall within mapping time range
       // Adjust timestamps to timeline position
       // Emit as WebVTT cues
     }
   }
   ```

A few questions to refine this further:

1. **Workout transitions**: When a clip spans two workouts, how should we handle the transition? Just continue with samples from the next workout file?

2. **Time precision**: TCX samples might not align perfectly with video frames. Should we:

   - Use the nearest sample?
   - Only include samples that fall exactly within the clip bounds?

3. **Sample rate**: Should the tool respect the original TCX sample rate, or resample to a consistent rate (e.g., 1 Hz)?

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this approach?

## User Prompt

First, some answers:

1. When a clip spans two workouts, we indeed should just continue with samples from the next workout file.

2. Regarding time precision and video frames, we should use the nearest sample. That said, I am not sure if WebVTT is frame precise anyway — I believe it is time based? So we probably don’t need to worry too much about frame precision.

3. Regarding sample rate, again I think we should respect the timing of the samples.

Now, let’s think about the data structures we will need. Given that we may be given multiple TCX files — a this only just occurred to me, that there may be overlapping workouts — what datastructure should we store the samples in. IMO, it makes sense to throw all samples into a heap, sorted by their timestamps. Does this make sense to you, given how we will likely need to iterate over the video timeline?

## Claude

<details>
<summary>Thought Process</summary>

The user is thinking about handling multiple TCX files and the possibility of overlapping workouts. They're suggesting throwing all samples into a heap sorted by timestamps.

Let me think about this:

1. They could have overlapping workouts (e.g., two devices recording the same activity, or maybe a bike computer and a watch)
2. They need to iterate through the video timeline sequentially
3. They need to find samples that correspond to specific times in the video

A heap is interesting, but I'm not sure it's the best structure here. A heap gives you efficient min/max extraction, but:

- You can't efficiently search for samples at a specific time
- You can't easily iterate through a time range

I think what they really need is:

1. A sorted array or tree structure that allows efficient searching by timestamp
2. A way to handle overlapping workouts (maybe prioritization or merging?)

Let me explore this...

</details>

Yes, I see where you're going with the heap idea, but I think we might want a slightly different approach. While a heap is great for priority queue operations, for this use case we need efficient **range queries** - "give me all samples between time X and Y" - which a heap doesn't support well.

Here's what I'm thinking:

```typescript
interface IndexedSample {
  timestamp: Date
  sourceFile: string // to track where it came from
  data: Record<string, any>
}

// Store all samples in a sorted array
class SampleIndex {
  private samples: IndexedSample[] = []

  addWorkout(filename: string, samples: TCXSample[]) {
    // Add samples with source tracking
    const indexed = samples.map((s) => ({
      ...s,
      sourceFile: filename,
    }))
    this.samples.push(...indexed)
    this.samples.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp.getTime() - b.timestamp.getTime())
  }

  // Binary search to find samples in time range
  getSamplesInRange(startTime: Date, endTime: Date): IndexedSample[] {
    const startIdx = this.binarySearch(startTime)
    const endIdx = this.binarySearch(endTime)
    return this.samples.slice(startIdx, endIdx + 1)
  }

  // Get nearest sample to a specific time
  getNearestSample(time: Date): IndexedSample | null {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

**Handling Overlapping Workouts**: This raises an important question - if you have two workouts recording the same time period (e.g., both a bike computer and watch recording), how should we handle conflicts?

Options:

1. **Keep all samples**: The WebVTT would have multiple cues at the same timestamp
2. **Priority by source**: Prefer one device over another (user-specified priority?)
3. **Merge samples**: Combine data from both sources into one cue
4. **First/Last wins**: Take the first or last loaded file's data

What's your preference? This affects how we structure the data.

For the timeline iteration, the approach would be:

```typescript
for (const clip of timeline) {
  const clipStartTime = clip.contentCreated + clip.offset
  const clipEndTime = new Date(clipStartTime.getTime() + clip.duration * 1000)

  const samples = sampleIndex.getSamplesInRange(clipStartTime, clipEndTime)

  for (const sample of samples) {
    const videoTime = (sample.timestamp - clipStartTime) / 1000 + clip.timelineStart
    // Emit WebVTT cue at videoTime
  }
}
```

Does this approach make more sense than a heap for your use case?

## User Prompt

Merging samples would be my preference.

This does indeed make sense, and is a better approach than a heap.

In what scenario do you envision the `getNearestSample()` to be used?

## Claude

<details>
<summary>Thought Process</summary>

The user is asking about when `getNearestSample()` would be used. Let me think about this in the context of the tool they're building.

They mentioned:

1. Using nearest sample for time precision/video frames
2. Respecting the timing of samples
3. Creating WebVTT tracks with JSON metadata for video overlay widgets

Actually, looking back at my suggestion, I'm not sure `getNearestSample()` is needed for the main use case. The primary operation is:

1. Get all samples within a time range (for each clip)
2. Transform those samples to WebVTT cues at the appropriate video timeline position

The "nearest sample" concept was mentioned by the user in response to my question about time precision, but I think they meant that when samples don't align perfectly with clip boundaries, we should include the nearest samples rather than being strict about boundaries.

So I should probably clarify that `getNearestSample()` might not be needed, or explain specific edge cases where it could be useful.

</details>

Good question - looking back at it, `getNearestSample()` might not actually be necessary for the core functionality. I was initially thinking about edge cases, but let me reconsider...

The main operation is extracting samples within time ranges and mapping them to the video timeline. The "nearest sample" concept you mentioned was more about boundary handling - when a clip starts/ends between samples.

However, there might be a few scenarios where it could be useful:

1. **Thumbnail/Preview Generation**: If you later want to show a preview of data at a specific video timestamp (like when hovering over the timeline)

2. **Clip Start Validation**: To show the user what data is available at the Content Created timestamp when setting up mappings

3. **Sparse Data Handling**: If some TCX data streams are very sparse (e.g., GPS updates every 5-10 seconds), you might want to carry forward the last known position

But for the core WebVTT generation, you're right - we probably just need:

- `getSamplesInRange()`
- Maybe `getSamplesBetween()` with inclusive/exclusive options for boundaries

Should we drop `getNearestSample()` from the design, or do any of those use cases seem relevant for future features?

Also, for merging samples from overlapping workouts, I'm thinking:

```typescript
interface MergedSample {
  timestamp: Date
  sources: string[] // which files contributed
  data: Record<string, any> // merged data, with conflict resolution
}
```

How would you want to handle conflicts when the same field (e.g., heart rate) has different values in overlapping workouts?

## User Prompt

For reference, here is the current data structure for samples:

```typescript
export enum SampleMetric {
  HeartRate = 'heartRate',
  Distance = 'distance',
  Cadence = 'cadence',
  Power = 'power',
  Location = 'location',
}

export interface Coordinates {
  latitude: number
  longitude: number
  altitude?: number
}

export type SampleValue<T extends SampleMetric> = T extends SampleMetric.Location
  ? Coordinates
  : number

export class Sample<T extends SampleMetric = SampleMetric> {
  constructor(
    public readonly time: Date,
    public readonly metric: T,
    public readonly value: SampleValue<T>
  ) {}
}
```

You bring up some good use cases for getting the nearest sample. But I think for now we can remain focused on generating the WebVTT track and if we need to do something for sparse GPS data we can figure that out when it comes up.

Regarding conflicts in samples with the same metrics, that is a really good point. I think maybe the CLI tool will need a way to specify metrics to ignore in some workout files. Interleaving samples of the same metric from different devices seems like it would cause issues. Unless you can think of an alternative solution to this?

## Claude

<details>
<summary>Thought Process</summary>

The user has shown me their current data structure for samples. It's interesting - they use a single Sample class that can only hold one metric at a time. This means a single point in time might have multiple Sample objects (one for heart rate, one for location, etc.).

This is different from what I was assuming - I was thinking of samples as having all metrics at once. This changes how we need to think about merging.

For conflicts, the user is right that interleaving the same metric from different devices would be problematic. The CLI option to ignore certain metrics from certain files makes sense.

Let me think about alternatives:

1. Priority-based resolution (prefer device A over device B for heart rate)
2. Averaging (probably bad for most metrics)
3. Keep both and namespace them (heartRate_garmin vs heartRate_wahoo)
4. Smart merging based on data quality/consistency

The user's suggestion of ignoring metrics from certain files is probably the most straightforward.

</details>

Ah, I see - your current structure has one metric per Sample object. This actually makes the merging problem clearer. When we collect samples into our index, we'll have multiple Sample objects at the same timestamp.

Given this structure, here's how I'd adapt the index:

```typescript
class SampleIndex {
  // Group samples by timestamp, then by metric
  private samplesByTime: Map<number, Map<SampleMetric, Sample[]>> = new Map()
  private sortedTimestamps: number[] = []

  addWorkout(filename: string, samples: Sample[], ignoredMetrics?: Set<SampleMetric>) {
    for (const sample of samples) {
      // Skip ignored metrics for this file
      if (ignoredMetrics?.has(sample.metric)) continue

      const timeKey = sample.time.getTime()
      if (!this.samplesByTime.has(timeKey)) {
        this.samplesByTime.set(timeKey, new Map())
        this.sortedTimestamps.push(timeKey)
      }

      const metricsMap = this.samplesByTime.get(timeKey)!
      if (!metricsMap.has(sample.metric)) {
        metricsMap.set(sample.metric, [])
      }
      metricsMap.get(sample.metric)!.push(sample)
    }

    // Keep timestamps sorted
    this.sortedTimestamps.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  }

  getSamplesInRange(start: Date, end: Date): Sample[] {
    // Binary search to find range, then flatten all samples
    // Handle conflicts per metric type
  }
}
```

For the CLI interface to specify ignored metrics:

```bash
tcx2webvtt --fcp project.fcpxmld \
  workout1.tcx \
  workout2.tcx:ignore=heartRate,cadence \
  workout3.tcx:ignore=location
```

Alternative approach - instead of ignoring, specify priority:

```bash
tcx2webvtt --fcp project.fcpxmld \
  --metric-priority heartRate=workout1.tcx \
  --metric-priority location=workout2.tcx \
  workout1.tcx workout2.tcx
```

Which style do you prefer? Or maybe both options would be useful?
